# AoC 2022 in Kotlin
This is my excuse to learn Kotlin, as I'm writing in it for the first time :)<br>
I must say, I've been *really* liking it!<br>
Maybe I'll do other projects in Kotlin from now on (Already tried Kotlin/Native, it's like magic).<br>
Anywhom though, these are most or some solutions for [AoC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).<br>
The commits from @rozbrajaczpoziomow are the same as it would be me committing, but I was too lazy to change git SSH auth keys, because they are a pain...<br>
